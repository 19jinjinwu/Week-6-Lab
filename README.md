# Week 7 Lab

Welcome to our python program! Here, we will be asking for the users' names and majors, and then printing the output. Our program also allows the user to play a guessing the number game.

## Sample output of code:
Name and Major
```
How many members in your group: 2
What is your name? Bob
What is your major? Computer Science
What is your name? Jill
What is your major? Information Science
Bob's Major is: Computer Science
Jill's Major is: Information Science
```
Guess the Number Game

Too low! Try again
